# Stake-map
I have created an app to see the wards under stakes in Edmonton. For this, I have imported the property assessment data of Edmonton in google my Maps to generate my own app. After that, I drew lines to make the boundary of each stake on the map. Then to deploy the map app publically i used Streamlit. The user can open the link below, get access to it, and view each stake. 

About files: "mapapp.py" contains the Python code of the map and "maprequirements.txt" contains the requirements if the user wan to run the code on their device.
